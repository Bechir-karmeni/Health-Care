# Description
> So guys here comes one of the most advanced Machine Learning medical projects that I have done till now in my whole Machine Learning journey. It is called 𝑯𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒕𝒉&𝑪𝒂𝒓𝒆which is an all-in-one medical solution. We know the future is all about AI so here is my idea of bringing 7 disease detections under one platform using the power of AI. Although these results are perfect yet an experiment i did, which can prove to be a revolution in the coming years. The main advantage of this project is that we can get the test results immediately at our home with a just few clicks.
