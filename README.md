# Description
> So guys here comes one of the most advanced Machine Learning medical projects that I have done till now in my whole Machine Learning journey. It is called 𝑯𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒕𝒉&𝑪𝒂𝒓𝒆which is an all-in-one medical solution. We know the future is all about AI so here is my idea of bringing 7 disease detections under one platform using the power of AI. Although these results are perfect yet an experiment i did, which can prove to be a revolution in the coming years. The main advantage of this project is that we can get the test results immediately at our home with a just few clicks.




>𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: 



𝑪𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒅-19 𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

       - Used custom-made CNN architecture for this detection.

       - The accuracy achieved was around 93%



𝑩𝒓𝒂𝒊𝒏 𝑻𝒖𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒅𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

        - Used VGG-16 for feature extraction.

        -The accuracy achieved was around 99%(Just Tested on 10 Images)

         -Used custom-made CNN ahead of CNN.



𝑩𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒕 𝑪𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆𝒓 𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

         -Used Random Forest for this use case.

         -The accuracy achieved was around 91%



𝑨𝒍𝒛𝒉𝒆𝒊𝒎𝒆𝒓 𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

         -Trained CNN architecture for this use case.

         -The accuracy achieved was around 73%



𝑫𝒊𝒂𝒃𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒔 𝒅𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

        -Used Random Forest for this use case.

        -The accuracy achieved was around 66%



𝑷𝒏𝒆𝒖𝒎𝒐𝒏𝒊𝒂 𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

        -Used custom CNN architecture for this use case.

        -The accuracy achieved was around 83%



𝑯𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒕 𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒆 𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

       -Used XGBoost for this use case.

       -The accuracy achieved was around 86%
